[ ] The way we do crossover right now can easily introduce cycles in
    the graph. We want to avoid that. For every excess or disjoint gene,
    check if it creates a cycle. Matching genes cannot introduce cycles.
[ ] Implement the mutation of weights.
[ ] Add DeleteConnection structural mutation
[ ] Include node gene compatibility into the overall compatibility measure
    for speciation.
[ ] Think about using a mutation method based on the crossover of matching
    genes, using a method to combine their weights.
