[ ] A link gene can be uniquely identified by their source and target node
    innovation numbers (if we disallow multiple links between two nodes).
[ ] Use a single representation instead of trying to keep the node/link
    gene list and the network representation in sync. This will simply
    the code a lot.
[ ] Implement the mutation of weights.
[ ] Add DeleteConnection structural mutation
[ ] Include node gene compatibility into the overall compatibility measure
    for speciation.
[ ] Think about using a mutation method based on the crossover of matching
    genes, using a method to combine their weights.
